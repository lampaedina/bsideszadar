    <p class="intro-paragraph tabs-paragraph">Zadar is a compact city, which makes it easy to explore on foot. You can access many places within minutes, whether you&#x27;re strolling through the historic old town or along the scenic waterfront. This also means you can save on accommodation costs by choosing a place slightly further from the conference venue. Properties closer to the sea, old city core, or with scenic views generally charge higher rates. <br><br>Due to the dynamic nature of lodging availability and the close date of the conference, we recommend using platforms like Airbnb or Booking.com for your stay in Zadar. These services offer a wide range of options, from budget-friendly rooms to luxury accommodations, and provide the flexibility to choose what best fits your needs. <br><br>‍<strong>Airbnb </strong>- explore unique stays and experiences in Zadar on Airbnb <br>‍<strong>Booking.com </strong>- find hotels and other accommodations at competitive rates on Booking.com <br><br>Booking through these platforms allows you to secure accommodation that is up-to-date with real-time availability and rates, ensuring you find a place that suits your preferences and budget. </p>

    <p class="intro-paragraph tabs-paragraph">Navigating parking in Zadar requires a bit of planning, especially during peak tourist seasons. Here’s a guide to help you find the most convenient options: <br><br>‍<strong>Hotel Kolovare Parking:</strong> Conveniently located at the conference venue, Hotel Kolovare offers on-site parking at a rate of 1 EURO per hour. This option is especially practical if you&#x27;re attending events or staying at the hotel. <br><br><strong>Public Parking:</strong> Zadar offers various public parking areas close to the venue and popular tourist sites.

Additionally, parking at large grocery stores nearby typically allows free parking for the first 1 or 2 hours, after which a small fee applies. <br><br>‍<strong>Seafront Parking:</strong> Parking along the scenic seafront offers beautiful views and proximity to many attractions. However, finding a spot here can be challenging due to high demand. If you&#x27;re willing to try your luck, it could be rewarding, but be prepared for alternatives. <br><br>‍<strong>Respecting Local Rules:</strong> Always adhere to local parking regulations to avoid fines and towing. Parking only in designated areas and paying the required fees is crucial. Proper parking etiquette ensures the area remains accessible and pleasant for everyone. </p>
