        <h3 class="cell-heading small-padding"><strong>Be associated with the next big thing</strong></h3>
        <p class="blue-paragraph small-padding">Nobody knows what the “next big thing” will be, but these events are community driven with presentations voted upon by the industry. There is no magic to how it works, but we believe that listening to the underground can help prepare you and help identify what the next big thing might be.</p>
